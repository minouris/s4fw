  - On **Linux**: Supported via **Steam** and/or **Proton** (see setup instructions below)
- **(Optional) GitHub CLI** (`gh`) for command-line forking
- **(Optional) unzip** for extracting the template zip

---

## Structure

- `src/`: Your mod code (to be included in releases)
- `build/`: The location that compiled code is built to when the `Build Mod` task is run
- `dist/`: The location that `.ts4script` are written to when the `Package Mod` task is run
- `mods/`: Mods run by Sims 4, and where packages are copied to by the `Deploy Mod` task
- `ea_api`: External mount (by Docker) of EA `Data/Simulation/Gameplay` folder for API zips
- `lib/external/`: External python libraries (for build/debug only, not for release)
- `lib/ea/`: Decompiled EA Python source (output from decompiling .pyc files)
- `ea_compiled/`: Compiled Python files from EA (unpacked by [tools/unpack.sh](tools/unpack.sh))
- `tools/`: Decompiler tool(s) for Sims 4 .pyc files

## Devcontainer
This project uses a devcontainer with Python 3.7 for compatibility with Sims 4 scripting.

### Complete the Setup

#### 1. Install Prerequisites

- **[See detailed instructions for installing VSCode and Docker on Linux and WSL in `doc/REQUIREMENTS.md`](doc/REQUIREMENTS.md)**

#### 3. Configure Devcontainer and EA API Mount

You can use the provided setup scripts to automatically configure your environment, or edit the configuration manually.

**Recommended: Use the Setup Scripts**

- **On WSL2 (Windows):**
  - Use the setup script to detect your Sims 4 installation and create your devcontainer:
    ```sh
    setup/setup.sh
    ```
    This script will:
    - Attempt to automatically locate your Sims 4 installation directory on Windows
    - Create or Update your `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` to mount the correct EA API folder into the devcontainer
    - Create or Update your `.devcontainer/Dockerfile` to create a Python3.7 container
    - Prompt you to enter or confirm mod metadata (such as mod name, author, and description)
    - Create or update your `mod_info.json` file with the provided information

- **On Linux (Steam/Proton):**
  - Use the setup script to detect your Sims 4 installation and create your devcontainer:
    ```sh
    setup/setup_linux_proton.sh
    ```
    This script will:
    - Attempt to automatically locate your Sims 4 installation directory under your Steam library (including Proton prefixes if used)
    - Create or Update your `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` to mount the correct EA API folder into the devcontainer
    - Create or Update your `.devcontainer/Dockerfile` to create a Python3.7 container
    - Prompt you to enter or confirm mod metadata (such as mod name, author, and description)
    - Create or update your `mod_info.json` file with the provided information

**Manual Setup (Alternative):**

- **On All Platforms**
  - Copy `setup/.templates/mod_info.json` to the project root:

    ```bash
    $ cp -rf setup/.templates/mod_info.json ./ 
    ```

    It should look like this:

    ```json
    {
        "name": "__MOD_NAME__",
        "author": "__MOD_AUTHOR__",
        "version": "0.0.1-SNAPSHOT",
        "description": "",
        "gameversion": "__GAME_VERSION__",
        "depends": []
    }
    ```
  - Set up the values in `mod_info.json`:
    - Replace `__MOD_NAME__` in `mod_info.json` with your mod's name (avoid spaces, use dots instead)
    - Replace `__AUTHOR_NAME__` in `mod_info.json` with your name (avoid spaces, use dots instead)
    - Replace `__GAME_VERSION__` in `mod_info.json` with the current version of your game, e.g., `1.118.257.1020`
    - Enter a `description` and adjust the `version` if you like

    It should now look similar to this:

    ```json
    {
        "name": "find.the.ultimate.question",
        "author": "arthur.phillip.dent",
        "version": "0.0.1-SNAPSHOT",
        "description": "Find the question that yields the answer to thea meaning of life, the universe, and everything, which is 42.",
        "gameversion": "1.118.257.1020",
        "depends": []
    }

    ```

  - Copy `setup/.templates/.devcontainer` to the project root:

    ```bash
    $ cp -rf setup/.templates/.devcontainer ./ 
    ```

- **On WSL2 (Windows):**

  - In your `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`, locate the following section (this is how it appears by default):

    ```json
    "mounts": [
      "source=__SIMS4_EA_ZIPS_PATH__,target=/workspaces/s4fw/ea_api,type=bind,readonly",
      "source=__SIMS4_MODS_PATH__,target=/workspaces/s4fw/mods,type=bind",
      "source=/etc/timezone,target=/etc/timezone,type=bind,readonly",
      "source=/etc/localtime,target=/etc/localtime,type=bind,readonly"
    ]
    ```

  - **Replace** the `__SIMS4_EA_ZIPS_PATH__` and `__SIMS4_MODS_PATH__` placeholders with the actual paths to your Sims 4 EA API folder and Mods folder. Do not add new mountsâ€”just replace the variables in the existing lines.
    - `__SIMS4_EA_ZIPS_PATH__`: Path to your Sims 4 EA API folder (e.g., `/mnt/c/Program Files/EA Games/The Sims 4/Data/Simulation/Gameplay`)
    - `__SIMS4_MODS_PATH__`: Path to your Sims 4 Mods folder (e.g., `/mnt/c/Users/<your-windows-username>/Documents/Electronic Arts/The Sims 4/Mods`)
  - **Example after replacing:**
    ```json
    "mounts": [
      "source=/mnt/c/Program Files/EA Games/The Sims 4/Data/Simulation/Gameplay,target=/workspaces/s4fw/ea_api,type=bind,readonly",
      "source=/mnt/c/Users/<your-windows-username>/Documents/Electronic Arts/The Sims 4/Mods,target=/workspaces/s4fw/mods,type=bind",
      "source=/etc/timezone,target=/etc/timezone,type=bind,readonly",
      "source=/etc/localtime,target=/etc/localtime,type=bind,readonly"
    ]
    ```
    - Replace `<your-windows-username>` with your actual Windows username.
    - Use forward slashes and WSL/Unix format for all paths.

- **On Linux (Steam/Proton):**
    
  - In your `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`, the original section is the same as in WSL2:

    ```json
    "mounts": [
      "source=__SIMS4_EA_ZIPS_PATH__,target=/workspaces/s4fw/ea_api,type=bind,readonly",
      "source=__SIMS4_MODS_PATH__,target=/workspaces/s4fw/mods,type=bind",
      "source=/etc/timezone,target=/etc/timezone,type=bind,readonly",
      "source=/etc/localtime,target=/etc/localtime,type=bind,readonly"
    ]
    ```

  - **Replace** the placeholders as follows:
    - `__SIMS4_EA_ZIPS_PATH__`: Path to your Sims 4 EA API folder (e.g., `/home/<your-username>/.steam/steam/steamapps/common/The Sims 4/Data/Simulation/Gameplay`)
    - `__SIMS4_MODS_PATH__`: Path to your Sims 4 Mods folder (e.g., `/home/<your-username>/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/compatdata/<proton-app-id>/pfx/drive_c/users/steamuser/Documents/Electronic Arts/The Sims 4/Mods`)
  - **Example after replacing:**
    ```json
    "mounts": [
      "source=/home/<your-username>/.steam/steam/steamapps/common/The Sims 4/Data/Simulation/Gameplay,target=/workspaces/s4fw/ea_api,type=bind,readonly",
      "source=/home/<your-username>/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/compatdata/<proton-app-id>/pfx/drive_c/users/steamuser/Documents/Electronic Arts/The Sims 4/Mods,target=/workspaces/s4fw/mods,type=bind",
      "source=/etc/timezone,target=/etc/timezone,type=bind,readonly",
      "source=/etc/localtime,target=/etc/localtime,type=bind,readonly"
    ]
    ```
    - Replace `<your-username>` and `<proton-app-id>` as appropriate.
    - If you run Sims 4 natively, use your home Documents path instead for the Mods folder

## Next Steps: Open the Devcontainer and Prepare Your Modding Environment

### 1. Open the Devcontainer

- Open the project folder in Visual Studio Code.
- If prompted, click "Reopen in Container" (or use the Command Palette: `Remote-Containers: Reopen in Container`).
- Wait for the devcontainer to build and initialize.

*End result: Your development environment is set up with all required tools and paths.*

### 2. Unpack the EA API Zips

You must extract the EA `.pyc` files from the official zips before decompiling.

**Using VSCode Task:**
- Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`), select `Tasks: Run Task`, and choose **Unpack EA API Zips**.

**Or using the command line:**
```sh
bash tools/unpack.sh
```

*End result: EA `.pyc` files are extracted into the `ea_compiled/` directory.*

### 3. Decompile the EA Python Sources

Decompile the `.pyc` files to `.py` sources.

**Using VSCode Task:**
- Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`), select `Tasks: Run Task`, and choose one of:
  - **Decompile EA Scripts (Resume)** (recommended for most cases)
  - **Decompile EA Scripts (Clean)** (removes previous output first)
  - **Decompile EA Scripts (With Trace)** (for verbose output)

**Or using the command line:**
```sh
bash tools/decompile.sh --input-dir=ea_compiled --output-dir=lib/ea
```

*End result: Decompiled EA Python source files are available in the `lib/ea/` directory.*

### 4. Build Your Mod

Place the Python source code for your mod under the `src` folder.

Compile your mod source code from `src/` into the `build/` director, by one of the following methods:

**Using VSCode Task:**
- Open the Command Palette, select `Tasks: Run Task`, and choose **Build Mod**.

**Or using the command line:**
```sh
bash tools/build.sh
```

Your scripts will be compiled to `.pyc` files in your `build/` directory

### 5. Package Your Mod

Package your built mod files into a `.ts4script` archive in the `dist/` directory.

**Using VSCode Task:**
- Open the Command Palette, select `Tasks: Run Task`, and choose **Package Mod**.

**Or using the command line:**
```sh
bash tools/package.sh
```

This will create a `.ts4script` file in your `dist` folder, using the details from your `mod_info.json` file.

For example, if your `mod_info.json` file looks like:

  ```json
  {
      "name": "find.the.ultimate.question",
      "author": "arthur.phillip.dent",
      "version": "0.0.1-SNAPSHOT",
      "description": "Find the question that yields the answer to thea meaning of life, the universe, and everything, which is 42.",
      "gameversion": "1.118.257.1020",
      "depends": []
  }

  ```

  Then your mod file will be called `dist/arthur.phillip.dent-find.the.ultimate.question-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.ts4script`

### 6. Deploy Your Mod

Copy your packaged mod into your Sims 4 Mods folder.

**Using VSCode Task:**
- Open the Command Palette, select `Tasks: Run Task`, and choose **Deploy Mod**.
- Or use **Build + Package + Deploy** to run all steps in sequence.

**Or using the command line:**
```sh
bash tools/deploy.sh
```

Your packaged mod is copied to the `mods/` directory (linked to your Sims 4 Mods folder).
